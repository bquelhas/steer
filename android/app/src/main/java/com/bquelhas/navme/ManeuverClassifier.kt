/**
 * Best-effort classification of an icon-only maneuver glyph (e.g. Google Maps'
 * notification largeIcon) into a [Direction], so the watch can draw its own
 * Pebble-style PDC arrow from NAV_TURN instead of blitting the foreign raster glyph.
 *
 * Input is the packed 1-bpp 48x48 mask produced by [IconConverter]. We model the
 * arrow as a stem rising from the bottom with a head pointing toward the turn,
 * estimate the head direction geometrically, and bin the angle to a maneuver.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative: [Confidence.HIGH] is reported only for clean,
 * unambiguous simple turns. Anything circular/branching (roundabouts, forks) or
 * with odd coverage stays [Confidence.LOW] so the caller keeps forwarding the raw
 * glyph (no regression vs. today). Every glyph is also reduced to a coarse
 * [fingerprint] so a labelled lookup table can be built from real drives later.
